# passgen

Simple Python / Tkinter password generator.
!!HIGHLY INSECURE, DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!!

This is obviously not packaged, but can be run from Python Shell or however you normally run python scripts.

Requires TK, which nearly all modern pythong packages come with, but otherwise, run "pip install tk" to get it.
